      <h1>Rikers Island’s Unspoken Crisis: Mental Health Access to Inmates and Their Families</h1>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the danger to people incarcerated at Rikers Island, but many of the issues aren’t pandemic related. On September 15th, speakers in front of New York City Hall called for Mayor de Blasio to act on, decarcerate, end solitary confinement, shift to models that improve the well-being and safety of inmates, and give power to the commissioner to grant pardons. </p>

      <p>The lack of resources available to help inmates navigate their mental health needs is causing the number of self-harm cases in jails across the city to exacerbate. And Peggy Herrera, a mother of an inmate who suffers from mental health challenges describes the lack of resources as her “main obstacle as a mother” to get help for her son. </p>

<p>“Where is the help for me?” asks Herrera. And just like her, many family members from people in jails need and want help. Treatment is currently not offered to anyone other than inmates directly through any of the services described. And yet, the trauma their families go through is unspoken and often goes untreated.</p>

<p> She also describes the correctional system as one where “they are quick to criminalize and not offer help.” After also getting arrested in 2019 and later having her charges dismissed for obstructing the police from arresting her son Justin while responding to a 911 call she made to get her son helped when he was going through a mental health crisis.</p> 


      <p>There are over 5,500 people in custody today - this is by public data available through Grater Justice NY.</p>

      <p>3 ways for released inmates and incarcerated individuals to seek help in New York City:</p>
